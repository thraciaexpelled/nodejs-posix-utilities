# nodejs-posix-utilities
this is a collection of a couple of POSIX/Unix
utilities that is implemented in javascript.

i'm so (not) sorry for this.

## installing these
make sure you have python installed for auto
$PATH inferral.

> [!WARNING]
> YOU MUST INSTALL NPM DEPENDENCIES ***GLOBALLY***.
> OTHERWISE, THE UTILITIES WILL NOT WORK!!!!

there are two ways of installing these
utilities:

1. ### backup and replace existing utils
run `make reckless` to install the utilities
onto your unix-like system

2. ### install them with a prefix
run `make with-prefix` to install the
utilities with a "node.<util>" prefix.
